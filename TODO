* a bit better userspace makefile
* rename CamelCase symbols to linux_style (?)
* test on 32bit x86 qemu
* test on non-x86 hardware
* test on arm qemu:
	on qemu's armv5 for which debian image exists,
	snappy's tester has fp exception,
	csnappy is butt slow.
	Can Cortex A8 be emulated? Can install linux on such image?
* test with debug kernel
* test with modules linked in
* consider hash functions with better performance on other arches.
* consider hash table with say, 8, possible matches.
* check what compression ratio, speed, memory use looks like if instead of
 hash table with 16K entries for 32K values and no chaining we use a hash map
 that stores all values (establish upper limits).
